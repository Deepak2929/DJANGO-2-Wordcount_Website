Word-Counting Website:     A simple website to count the most frequently used words in a piece of text.

What is Django?
Django is an open-source web framework that is written in Python.
It was created about twelve years ago, but in December 2017 Django 2
was released with a whole new set of features and capabilities! 

Django is an amazing framework for web developers because it provides
the infrastructure required for database-driven websites that have user
authentication, content administration, contact forms, file uploads,
and more. Instead of creating all of these features from scratch, you 
can use the Django framework and utilize these components that are already built, 
and focus your time on developing your web app instead. 

If you're going to be working with Python, especially for web applications or
web design, you should learn the Django framework. It will save you a ton of time!
